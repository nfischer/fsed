The fast, automated way to rename files.

fsed is the way to rename large numbers of files very efficiently. Here are some scenarios where fsed can be extremely useful:

* Do you want to make a copy of some files, but append something to the end of their name so you know they're different?
* Do you have files with 0001, 0002, etc. stuck at the front that you want to rename to have more easily readable names?
* Do you have a bunch of files that are related, but have names in totally different formats?
 * Ex. "hw_1.pdf", "hw2.pdf", "Week_3_HW.pdf"
